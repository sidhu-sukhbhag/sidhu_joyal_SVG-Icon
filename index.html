                <p>Zima Clearmalt is a clear, lightly carbonated alcoholic beverage made and distributed by the Coors Brewing Company or its licensees. Introduced in 1993, it was marketed as an alternative to beer, an example of what is now often referred to as a cooler, with 4.7â€“5.4% alcohol by volume.[1] Its production in the United States ceased in October 2008, but it was still marketed in Japan[2] until 2021, when sales ended due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[3] before returning in 2023.[4] On June 2, 2017, MillerCoors announced a limited release of Zima for the U.S. market. It was sold again in the U.S. in the summers of 2017 and 2018, but did not return in 2019.</p>
